Notes:

CFL:  

dealiased, vis=0
cfl_adv
4.0 unstable
2.0 unstable - at t=2 KE diss osscillating
1.0 at t=36 KE still looks good,plot is ok


aliased:  mu=0
2.0 unstable
1.0 unstable KE diss osscillating
.25  IN


plots at t=.5:
mu=.0001:  more viscous than dealiased.
mu=.00001: about the same
mu=.000001: about the same



aliased:  mu=.001    (damping time .0031s)
cfl=4.0:  t=2 looks bad - unstable at t=0.98
cfl=2.0:  t=6.9 unstable (ke going up)
cfl=1.5:  goes bad around t=8.4
cfl=1.4:  d/dt ke going bad, t=15
cfl=1.3:  d/dt ke going bad, t=15
cfl=1.25: look good, ran to t=100, ke down from 5000 to 11.15
cfl=1.2:  looks good.  rant to t=50, ke down from 5000 to 76
cfl=1.0:  t=10.0  looks good, ran to t=60, ke down from 5000 to 36.

aliased:  mu=.0001    (damping time .031s)
cfl=4.0: unstable t=.438  
cfl=2.0: looks good at t=1, blows up at t=5.3
cfl=1.0: blows up at t=5.3


aliased:  mu=.00001   (damping time: .31s)
cfl=4.0  IN
cfl=2.0:  unstable at t=?
cfl=1.0:  looks bad at t=.5, unstable t=.75
cfl=.5:   noisy at t=.5, but 8 nice rollups, unstable at t=.75






HEAT EQU.  fft, aliased
cfl_vis
 1.5  unstable t=.23 for vis=.01,  t=6.3 for vis=.001, t=.022 for vis=.1
 1.45 stable to t=1.0 for vis=.01, unstable with vis=.1 t=.1
 1.4  stable to t=1.0 for vis=.01, stable to t=.14 with vis=.1









poisson solve:  inner most tranform_to_z/transform_from_z pair
could be removed if we can compute the wave numbers of all
the coefficients in the z-decomposition .
