CFL:  

dealiased, vis=0
cfl_adv
1.6 t=6, energy up 50%
1.55 KE goes bad at 26.6
1.5 t=100 KE still looks good. didn't check plot
1.0 at t=36 KE still looks good,plot is ok


How much diffusion do we need so we can run at cfl=1.0?,
or since that has 2/3 of the full spectrum, cfl=.66?

aliased:  mu=.00001 
1.0  unstable
.10  unstable by t=10, probably earlier

aliased:  mu=.0001  
cfl
1.0  KE osscillationg around t=.8
.6:  unstable at t=18

aliased:  mu=.001  
cfl .6: unstable at t=10
aliased:  mu=.01  
cfl .6: STABLE - ran KE from 5000 down to 3

HEAT EQU.  fft, dealiased
mu=.01
cfl_vis
.40    unstable
.35    unstable
.30    stable - ran unil KE reduced 90%
.25    stable - ran until KE reduced 80%
 .1    stable - ran until KE reduced 50%.   








NOTES:

(1) poisson solve:  inner most tranform_to_z/transform_from_z pair
could be removed if we can compute the wave numbers of all
the coefficients in the z-decomposition .
