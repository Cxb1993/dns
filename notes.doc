Notes:

CFL:  

dealiased, vis=0
cfl_adv
2.0 unstable - at t=2 KE diss osscillating
1.5 ?
1.0 at t=36 KE still looks good,plot is ok

How much diffusion do we need so we can run at cfl=1.0?,
or since that has 2/3 of the full spectrum, cfl=.66?


aliased:  mu=0
.10 unstable  t=1.1


aliased:  mu=.00001 
1.0  unstable
.10  IN dosadi  looks stable still running...


aliased:  mu=.0001  
cfl
1.0  KE osscillationg around t=.8
.6:  IN







plots at t=.5:
mu=.0001:  more viscous than dealiased.
mu=.00001: about the same
mu=.000001: about the same



HEAT EQU.  fft, aliased
cfl_vis
  ?










poisson solve:  inner most tranform_to_z/transform_from_z pair
could be removed if we can compute the wave numbers of all
the coefficients in the z-decomposition .
