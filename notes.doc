10.0 unstable
5.0  stable, results bad at t=.5
4.5  ok,


aliased:  mu=0
10.0 unstable
5.0  unstable
2.5  unstable, t=.64
1.5  unstable t=.63
0.5  unstable t=.63

aliased:  mu=.0001    (damping time .031s)
cfl=4.0: unstable t=.438  
cfl=2.0: looks good at t=1, blows up at t=5.3
cfl=1.0: ?

aliased:  mu=.00001   (damping time: .31s)
cfl=2.0:  unstable at t=?
cfl=1.0:  looks bad at t=.5, unstable t=.75
cfl=.5:   noisy at t=.5, but 8 nice rollups, unstable at t=.75






HEAT EQU.  fft, aliased
cfl_vis
 1.5  unstable t=.23 for vis=.01,  t=6.3 for vis=.001, t=.022 for vis=.1
 1.45 stable to t=1.0 for vis=.01, unstable with vis=.1 t=.1
 1.4  stable to t=1.0 for vis=.01, stable to t=.14 with vis=.1









poisson solve:  inner most tranform_to_z/transform_from_z pair
could be removed if we can compute the wave numbers of all
the coefficients in the z-decomposition .
