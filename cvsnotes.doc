=================================================================
Initial Setup
=================================================================
Check that you can login to the CVS server by running:

% ssh solano.homeip.net


Put this in your .cshrc file: (or remember to set it everytime you
run any cvs commands):

setenv CVS_RSH ssh


=================================================================
Initial checkout of CVS repository (only done once)
=================================================================
cvs -d username@solano.homeip.net:/home/mt/cvsroot checkout dns

this will create a directory dns containing the source code



=================================================================
CVS commands
=================================================================
these commands are run from within the dns directory, or a subdirectory
of dns:

1. Get the latest version.  Any changes other people have committed will
be merged into your current checkout.

% cvs update


2. Commit changes you've made back to the repository:

% cvs commit


3. Get information about one of your checked out file:

% cvs status filename
