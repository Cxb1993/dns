1. ns_grid.F90.  

This is the main development platform used for debugging.  It is
signifcanlty slower then some of the other models.  Fully gridspace
based.  All work done in the 3d parallel decoposition.  
All operaters are computed via the der() subroutine.  It
handles spectral and 4th order via transpose operators.

1.1 ns_ibm.F90.  

A version of ns_grid.F90 which contains the Immersed Boundary Method


2. ns.F90

This is the optimized spectral code.  Most work is done in
the transform_to_z space with operations are done directly
on the fourier coefficients.  Nonlinear terms computed in
grid space using the regular 3d parallel decomposition.



3. ns_decomp3.F90

Spectral code were all work is done in the regular 3d parallel
decomposition space.  Not as fast as ns.F90 and no longer maintained.

4. ns_impulse.F90

A version of ns_grid.F90 that supports the impulse formulation
of the equations.  No longer maintined, but may be revived for
the NS-alpha model in U-V form.  

5. shallow.F90  

A 2D shallow water version of the model.  Supports alpha>=0 with the
div(tau) form of the equations.  Fourier and doubly periodic only (but
just because we use hyper viscosity.  Could be easily converted to
grid point model) See shallow.doc for some more documentation.


6. ns_ghost.F90

7. ns_psivor.F90

Running the code
1. setting the resolution

2. compiling

3. the input file

   line 1.  input file type.  0-4
   Each input file type has its own routine to read in the parameters
   in init_grid.F90.  4 is the newest input file format and the others
   should be considered obsolete.

4. running the code and command line options

5. restart files.
   To read a restart file on a machine
   with the opposit endian-ness of the machine which created the file,
   uncomment the 'call set_byteswap_input(1)' in dns.F90.
