Models:

ns_grid.F90             2D/3D NS main development platform 
ns.F90                  2D/3D NS and NS-alpha (div tau form)

ns_psivor.F90           2D NS streamfunction-vorticity form
cns.F90                 2D/3D compressible NS  using finite differences

1. ns_grid.F90.  To build:   'make dnsgrid'

This is the main development platform used for debugging.  It is
signifcanlty slower then some of the other models.  Fully gridspace
based.  All work done in the 3d parallel decoposition.  
All operaters are computed via the der() subroutine.  It
handles spectral and 4th order via transpose operators.

1.1 ns_ibm.F90.  To build:   'make dnsibm'

A version of ns_grid.F90 which contains the Immersed Boundary Method


2. ns.F90   To build:   'make dns'

This is the optimized spectral code.  Most work is done in
the transform_to_z space with operations are done directly
on the fourier coefficients.  Nonlinear terms computed in
grid space using the regular 3d parallel decomposition.



3. ns_decomp3.F90    To build:   'make dnsslow'

Spectral code were all work is done in the regular 3d parallel
decomposition space.  Not as fast as ns.F90 and no longer maintained.

4. ns_impulse.F90   To build:   'make dnsi'

A version of ns_grid.F90 that supports the impulse formulation
of the equations.  No longer maintined, but may be revived for
the NS-alpha model in U-V form.  

5. shallow.F90  To build:   'make dnss'

A 2D shallow water version of the model.  Supports alpha>=0 with the
div(tau) form of the equations.  Fourier and doubly periodic only (but
just because we use hyper viscosity.  Could be easily converted to
grid point model) See shallow.doc for some more documentation.


6. ns_ghost.F90     To build:   'make dnsghost'

7. ns_psivor.F90.   To build:   'make dnsvor'

8. cns.F90          To build:   'make cdns'
   compressible NS.

Running the code
1. setting the resolution

    ./gridsetup L M N  NX NY NZ  gx1 gy1 gz1  gx2 gy2 gz2  n_var

    L M N        = parallel decomposition.  
    NX NY NZ     = global grid
    gx1 gy1 gz1  = number of padding/ghost cells on right edge  (default = 2 2 0)
    gx2 gy2 gz2  = number of ghost cells on left edge (default = 0 0 0) 
    n_var        = number of variables   (default = 3)
 
    Examples:  to run the spectral code at 256^3 on 128 cpus:
    (doesn't need ghost cells, but needs a little extra storage for
     FFT's, provided by default values of gx1,gy1,gz1)

    ./gridsetup.py 1 1 128 256 256 256

    To run a 4th order finite difference code (needs 2 ghost cells in 
    every direction), with storage for (u,v,w):

    ./gridsetup.py 8 8 4 256 256 256 2 2 2  2 2 2 

    To run a 4th order finite difference code (needs 2 ghost cells in 
    every direction), with storage for (u,v,w,rho,p):

    ./gridsetup.py 8 8 4 256 256 256 2 2 2  2 2 2 5
