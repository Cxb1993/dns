\section{Scaling of the Domain}


\begin{figure}

\end{center}
\end{figure}



We would like to solve the NS equations in the box pictured in
Fig.~\ref{F:box}.  The equations are
\[
\frac{ \partial  \uv }{\partial t}  + (\curl \uv + f \khat) \times \uv + 
\grad \pi + N \theta \khat = \nu \Delta \uv
\]
\[
\grad \cdot \uv = 0
\]
\[
\frac{ \partial  \theta }{\partial t}  + \uv \cdot \grad \theta - 
N \uv \cdot \khat = \kappa \Delta \theta
\]
The Schmidt number is $\nu / \kappa$.  

We refer to the coordinate system in the box in Fig.~\ref{F:box} as
the primted coordinate system, and we now introduce a 
change of variables, into the {\em non-primed} coordinate
system.  In the non-primed coordinate system, the domain because a 
unit cube:
\[
x = x', \qquad y=y', \qquad  z = \frac{z'}{h},
\]
The only change to our code is that:
\[
\frac{\partial}{\partial z'} = \frac{1}{h} \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
\]
And thus 
\[
\grad = 
\begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{\partial}{\partial x} \\[5mm]
                \dfrac{\partial}{\partial y} \\[5mm]
                \dfrac{1}{h} \dfrac{\partial}{\partial z} 
\end{pmatrix}
 \qquad
\Delta  = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\right)^2 + 
           \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right)^2 +
           \left(\frac{1}{h}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\right)^2 
\]
and
\[
\grad \cdot \uv = \frac{\partial u_1 }{\partial x} + 
\frac{\partial u_2 }{\partial y} + 
\frac{1}{h} \frac{\partial u_3 }{\partial z}
\]
and  vorticity $\omegav$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{E:vor}
\omegav = \curl \uv = 
\begin{pmatrix}
\dfrac{\partial u_3}{\partial y} - \dfrac{1}{h} \dfrac{\partial u_2}{\partial z}  \\[5mm]
\dfrac{1}{h} \dfrac{\partial u_1}{\partial z} -  \dfrac{\partial u_3}{\partial x}  \\[5mm]
\dfrac{\partial u_2}{\partial x} - \dfrac{\partial u_1}{\partial y}
\end{pmatrix}  
\end{equation}


The divergence free condition on $\uv$ is solved by the choice
of $\pi$.  This involves, 
for some vector field ${\mathbf v}$, 
solving an equation of the form 
\[
\Delta \pi = \grad \cdot {\mathbf v}
\] 
The remaining equations we write in component form:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\
                u_2 \\
                u_3 \\
\end{pmatrix}_t
  + (\omegav + f \khat) \times 
\begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\
                u_2 \\
                u_3 \\
\end{pmatrix}
+ \grad \pi +
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\
                0 \\
                N \theta \\
\end{pmatrix}
= \nu 
\begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{\partial^2 u_1}{\partial x^2} + 
                \dfrac{\partial^2 u_1}{\partial y^2} + 
                \dfrac{1}{h^2}\dfrac{\partial^2 u_1}{\partial z^2}   \\[5mm]
                \dfrac{\partial^2 u_2}{\partial x^2} + 
                \dfrac{\partial^2 u_2}{\partial y^2} + 
                \dfrac{1}{h^2}\dfrac{\partial^2 u_2}{\partial z^2}   \\[5mm]
                \dfrac{\partial^2 u_3}{\partial x^2} + 
                \dfrac{\partial^2 u_3}{\partial y^2} + 
                \dfrac{1}{h^2}\dfrac{\partial^2 u_3}{\partial z^2}
\end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
\frac{ \partial  \theta }{\partial t}  + \uv \cdot \grad \theta - 
N u_3  = \kappa \left(
                \dfrac{\partial^2 \theta}{\partial x^2} + 
                \dfrac{\partial^2 \theta}{\partial y^2} + 
                \dfrac{1}{h^2}\dfrac{\partial^2 \theta}{\partial z^2}
\right)
\]



Thus the only changes needed for our parallel DNS code are is that
all derivatives in $z$ need to be scaled by $h$.


\section{Hyper Viscosity}
Consider our scaled hyper viscosity term
\[
\frac{ \partial  \uv }{\partial t} = 
\sqrt{E(k_\textrm{max})} \,  k_\textrm{max}^{-2\eta + 1.5}  \Delta^\eta \uv
\]
We first verify that the units are correct.  The units of
energy are $m^2/s^2$, so the units of the energy in a single
spherical shell $E(k)$ is $m^3/s^2$.  Thus we have
\[
\frac{m}{s^2} = \frac{m^{1.5}}{s} \,\frac{1}{m^{-2\eta+1.5}}  
                          \,\frac{1}{m^{2\eta}}
                           \, \frac{m}{s}
\]
In the frequency domain, 
\[
\frac{ \partial  u_3 }{\partial t} = 
\sqrt{E(k_\textrm{max})} \,  k_\textrm{max}^{-2\eta + 1.5}  
( (2\pi l)^2 + (2\pi m)^2 + (2\pi n/h)^2)^\eta u_3
\]

\section{Resolution Condition}

The assumptions made in the hydrostatic equations implicitly assume
(acording to Leslie) that 
\[
 \max{ k_h } << \min{k_z}
\]
which works out to (assuming 2/3 dealiasing)
\[
   \frac{N_x}{3} <<  \frac{1}{h}
\]



\section{Computing Scalars}
Integrals per unit volume are approximated by the sum
\[
<f,g> = \frac{1}{h} \iiint  f g  \, dx' \, dy' \, dz' =   \iiint  f g \, dx \, dy \, dz
=\frac{1}{N_x N_y N_z} \sum  f  g
\]
We also have that 
\[
\frac{1}{N_x N_y N_z} \sum  f  g = \sum \hat{f} \hat{g}
\]
so integrals can be computed in Fourier or grid space. 

All other scalars (kinetic energy, helicity, various dissipation
terms) are computed in physical coordinates.  So for example
\[
k = <\uv,\uv> = <u_1,u_1> + <u_2,u_2> +  <u_3,u_3>
\]
and the helicity 
\[
  h  = w_1 u_1  + w_2 u_2 + w_3 u_3
\]
As in example, using integer wave numbers $(l,m,n)$ (defined in the
next section), we have
\[
< \omegav , \Delta \uv> = \sum (2 \pi)^2 (l^2 + m^2 + (n/h)^2) 
\, \uv \cdot \omegav
\]





\section{Computing 3D Energy Spectra (in a spherical shell)}
If we choose to discretize our domain so that the 
maximum wave number (in the primed coordinate system) is
the same in all diretions, then
\[
\Delta x' = \Delta y' = \Delta z'
\]
Or
\[
N_x  = N_y = N_z/h
\]
where $N_x$ is the number of grid points in the $x$ direction.
The highest wave number is given by:
\[
k_x = \pi N_x, \qquad k_y = \pi N_y, \qquad k_z = \pi N_z/h 
\]
(Note that $\pi$ appears in the wave numbers since our domain is
of length 1 in the $x$ and $y$ diretions.)  The wave number spacing
is given by
\[
\Delta k_x = 2 \pi, \qquad  \Delta k_y = 2 \pi, \qquad  \Delta k_z = 2 \pi / h 
\]
In our DNS code, we index our arrays of Fourier coefficients
with integers $(l,m,n)$, with $l=0 \dots N_x/2$, 
$m=0 \dots N_y/2$ and 
$n=0 \dots N_z/2$.  The wave number spacing is given by
given by
\[
k_x = l \Delta k_x,, \qquad  k_y = m \Delta k_y, \qquad  k_z = n  \Delta k_z
\]
We index the arrays containing power spectra
such as $E(k)$ with integer wave number $k$, represents a shell or anulus
of some chosen thickness centered around the wave number associated
with $k$.

The total energy is
\[
E  = \sum_{l,m,n}  |  {\hat u_1}(l,m,n) |^2 +
 |  {\hat u_2}(l,m,n) |^2 + 
 |  {\hat u_3}(l,m,n) |^2
\]

The standard energy spectrum is now, for integers $k$:
\[
E(k)  = \sum_{l,m,n}  |  {\hat u_1}(l,m,n) |^2 +
 |  {\hat u_2}(l,m,n) |^2 + 
 |  {\hat u_3}(l,m,n) |^2
\]
where the sum is taken over all integers $(l,m,n)$ such that
\[
(\Delta k_z)^2 (k-1/2)^2 \le (\Delta k_x l)^2 + (\Delta k_y m)^2 + (\Delta k_z n)^2 <  (\Delta k_z)^2 (k+1/2)^2 
\]
where we have chosen to use a shell thickness of $\Delta k_z$.
Scaling out the $2\pi$, we get
\[
(k-1/2)^2 \le  h^2 \left( l^2 + m^2 + (n/h)^2 \right) < (k+1/2)^2
\]  





\section{Computing 2D Energy Spectra (in an annulus)}
We also compute a 2D spectra $E(k_h,k_z)$ by summing squares of Fourier
coefficients over annular regions in 
$x$ and $y$ of radius $k_h$.  
where 
\[
k_h = \sqrt{(k_x^2 + k_y^2)} = \sqrt{(2\pi l)^2 + (2\pi m)^2}. 
\]
From this quantity, we can get $E(k_h,0)$, which 
represents the energy spectrum of the 2D field
obtained by averaging the original 3D field  in the direction of rotation,
and then summing the energy within spherical shells (an annulus for 2D fields).
We are also interested in 
\begin{equation}
E(k_h) = \sum_{k_z=0}^{\pi N_z/h} E(k_h,k_z) 
\label{E:SPECb}
\end{equation}
which represents 
the energy spectrum of the full 3D field, but summed over
the annular region between concentric cylinders
(whose axis are in the $z$ direction).  As with the spherical
shell spectrum, Eq.~\ref{E:SPECb} has the property that
it partitions the energy into a set of discrete wave numbers, so
that the total energy 
\[
E = \sum_{k_h} E(k_h)
\]


The 2D shell (annulus) thickness is now
determined by the horizontal wavenumber spacings. In our code,
we use an integer index $k$ defined by $k_h = k \Delta k_x$ and
define
\begin{eqnarray*}
E(k,j) = \sum_{l,m}  |  {\hat u_1}(l,m,n) |^2 +
 |  {\hat u_2}(l,m,n) |^2 + 
 |  {\hat u_3}(l,m,n) |^2
\end{eqnarray*}
where the sum is taken over fixed $n$ and all integers $(l,m)$ such that 
\[
(\Delta k_h)^2 (j-1/2)^2 \le (\Delta k_x l)^2 + (\Delta k_y m)^2  <  (\Delta k_h)^2 (j+1/2)^2 
\]
and with $k_x=k \Delta k_x$ for integers $k$.  
we have chosen to use a shell thickness of $\Delta k_h =\Delta k_x = \Delta
k_y = 2\pi$. Scaling out the $2\pi$, we get
\[
(j-1/2)^2 \le  l^2 +  m^2 < (j+1/2)^2.
\]  

\section{Running the Model for the Boussinesq equations}

\noindent
This section discusses important elements of the inputfile and how to
build the executable.

When you've chosen scalar type = 4 in the gridsetup script (see
below), you need to add a line to the input file right after the line
for the smagorinsky coefficient,
\noindent
\begin{verbatim}
.
.
.
107.08        ! Bous. parameter  Fr = .21/bous=107.08
0e0           ! alpha (for NS-alpha model).  alpha>1 is in units of delx
.0            ! smagorinsky
1             ! max number of schmidt numbers for passive scalars
1. 4          ! schmidt number = nu/kappa, ratio of viscous coeffs,type of scalar
0             ! compute_structure_functions
.
.
. 
\end{verbatim}


Note that the type in this file must match the type in the gridsetup
command. Also note that if you want to the code to compute the
two-point correlations of potential vorticity then you need to set the
value of \texttt{compute structure functions} to 1.

\noindent
To set up the model you need to use the following:

\begin{description}
  
\item[1)] Example to set the FORTRAN arrays sizes before compiling:
  ($32^3$ simulation on 8 processors, prognostic variables: $u,v,w$
  and $\theta$). Note the 4 on the end, which
  indicates the type of scalar equations for the code to use \\
 
  \begin{verbatim}
      ./gridsetup.py 1 1 8 32 32 32 2 2 2 0 0 0 4
  \end{verbatim}

  \noindent
  This one sets up the problem for $128^3$ on 32 processors
  like this:

  \begin{verbatim}
   ./gridsetup.py 1 1 32 128 128 128 2 2 2 0 0 0 4
  \end{verbatim}

\item[2)] Then one makes the Boussinesq equations by
  typing\\

  \begin{verbatim}
  gmake dnsb
  \end{verbatim}
this  is identical to the dns code, except that it compiles in
the Boussinesq diagnostics (aspect\_diag.F90) 
instead of the usual turbulence
diagnostics (turb\_diag.F90). 
\end{description}

\noindent

\section{Comparing with Smith \& Waleffe (SW99 and SW02)}

\subsection{Scalings and definitions}

\subsubsection*{$\underline{\text{Wave numbers}}$}
Wave numbers are dimensional and should be computed $k_f = 2 \pi
k_f^m$, where the superscript $m$ stands for Mark. 

\subsubsection*{$\underline{\text{Rossby Number}}$}
SW02 computes this Rossby number,
\begin{equation}
  Ro = \frac{(k_f^2 \epsilon_f)^{1/3}}{\text{fcor}}, 
\end{equation}
where each number in the equation is computed as,
\begin{description}
   \item[1)] $k_f = 2 \pi k_f^m$
   \item[2)] $\epsilon_f$ is computed as an average through the run using
     scalars.m. It can also be found for each time in the output file
     if one looks at the $d/dt$ line and hunts for the f parameter (for
     the forcing).
  \item[3)] fcor is an input to the code. There is some question as to
    whether we should divide by $fcor/2$ or $fcor$, see SW02 Eq 3.2

\end{description}

\subsubsection*{$\underline{\text{Froude number}}$}

Modifications to the dns code to accomodate this is to include the
addition of a parameter {\bf{bous}} which multiplies the vertical
velocity in the  density anomoly equation. The equations we actually
solve in the code are,
We would like to solve the NS equations in the box pictured in
Fig.~\ref{F:box}.  The equations are
\[ 
\frac{ \partial  \uv }{\partial t}  + (\curl \uv + \text{fcor} ~\khat) \times \uv
+  
\grad \pi + \text{bous}~ \theta \khat = \nu \Delta \uv 
\] 
\[ 
\grad \cdot \uv = 0 
\] 
\[ 
\frac{ \partial  \theta }{\partial t}  + \uv \cdot \grad \theta -  
\text{bous} ~\uv \cdot \khat = \kappa \Delta \theta.
\] 
Therefore to compute a consistent Froude number,
\begin{equation}
Fr = \frac{(\epsilon_f k_f^2)^{1/3}}{\text{bous}}.
\end{equation}
Basically, $\text{bous}$ in the code is the is the same as $N$ in SW02 eq
2.1-2.3.



\subsubsection*{$\underline{\text{Time Scale}}$}
To be consistent with SM multiply the time in the output file by the
time scale from SM, $t_{sw02} = (\epsilon_f (2 \pi k_f)^2)^{1/3}$

First test, $f=0, N\ne0$. Choose $bous=107.08$ with hyperviscosity. Then

\begin{eqnarray}
Fr &=& \frac{\left((.5)(2 \pi 24)^{2}\right)^{1/3}}{107.08}= .21 \\ 
Ro &=& \frac{\left((.5)(2 \pi 24)^{2}\right)^{1/3}}{1.07077} = 21
\end{eqnarray} 
This means $\text{bous}=108.07$ and $\text{fcor} =1.07077 $ . We try
to produce the plots in Smith and Waleffe Figure 4 and 5.

Forcing is

\section{Test of projection routines in unit aspect ratio.  March 4, 2009}
The projection of the boussinesq data onto the Craya-Herring normal
modes is in spectrum.F90 in the compute\_project\_ch subroutine. This
routine is called from analysis\_spectral.F90 and decomposes a given
snapshot (gridspace) into its two wave and one vortical mode (SW02) in fourier space and computes the power spectra of those modes.

\subsection{Case SW02: $128^3$ gridpoints, $N/f = 100$, $Fr = 0.21$, $Ro = 21$} 
Figure \ref{NF100_time} shows the time evolution of the kinetic energy of the flow with the same non-linear time and energy units used in SW02 namely:
$$T = t(\varepsilon_f k_f^2)^{1/3}$$
$$energy = E(\varepsilon_f/k_f)^{-2/3}$$
This case was run upto T = 1151 in these units. Note that SW02
runs this case upto T=2200 (not shown in their Fig. 4) and plots their
spectra at T=2200. Comparing Fig. \ref{NF100_time} and the $N/f = 100$
curve of SW02 Fig. 4 upto time T = 800 (the maximum time-scale in
SW02) we notice slight differences which can probably be attributed to
the slight difference in our peak forcing wavenumbers (ours is
$k_f=24$, vs. SW02 $k_f=20$) and the fact that our $\epsilon_f \simeq
0.5$ whereas SW02 fixed theirs at $\epsilon_f = 1$. But the overall
shape of the curve, the time at which it starts to grow after an
initial equilibrium ($\approx T = 200$) is the same.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
  \includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{Comp_SW02_fig4_Nf100}
\caption{Evolution in time of the kinetic energy. To be compared with $N/f = 100$ curve in Figure 4 of SW02.\label{NF100_time}}
\end{figure}

The energy spectra of the total energy as well as the wave, vortical
and $k_h=0$ VSHF modes is given in Fig. \ref{NF100_spec}. This is
computed at our latest time of $T=1151$, to be compared with the SW02
Fig. 5 computed at T = 2200. The differences can probably be
attributed both to the later time of SW02 and the slight differences
in our forcing wavenumber, energy input rate $\epsilon_f$. But the
qualitative agreement is good. The $k_h = 0$ VSHF modes carry most of
the energy in the peak low-wavenumbers. An unexplained difference is
the 'peaky' nature of the low-mode energy distribution ($5< k < 10$)
in SW02 Fig. 5. This does not appear in our runs. We show in addition
the wave and vortical mode spectra which SW02 does not show. We do not
show the potential energy spectrum which SW02 does show.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Case SW02: $128^3$ gridpoints, $N/f = 10$, $Fr = 0.21$, $Ro = 2.1$}
Figure \ref{NF10_time} shows the time evolution of the kinetic energy
of the flow with the same non-linear time and energy units used in
SW02. This case was run upto about T = 690 in those units. Note that SW02
runs this case upto T=605. Comparing Fig. \ref{NF10_time} and the $N/f = 10$
curve of SW02 Fig. 4 upto time T = 605 (the maximum time-scale in
SW02) we notice slight differences which can probably be attributed to
the fact that our $\epsilon_f \simeq
0.5$ whereas SW02 fixed theirs at $\epsilon_f = 1$. But the overall
shape of the curve, the time at which it starts to grow after an
initial equilibrium ($\approx T = 200$) is the same.

\end{figure}

The energy spectra of the total energy for this run as well as the
wave, vortical and $k_h=0$ VSHF modes is given in Fig.
\ref{NF10_spec}. This is computed at our latest time of $T=690$, to be
compared with the SW02 Fig. 9 computed at T = 605. The differences can
probably be attributed both to the slightly earlier time of SW02 and
the slight differences in our energy input rate $\epsilon_f$. The
qualitative agreement is good. An unexplained difference is the
'peaky' nature of the low-mode energy distribution ($10< k < 15$) in
SW02 Fig. 9, This does not appear in our runs although we do have a
smooth peaking of the energy in the same wavenumber range.  The $k_h =
0$ (VSHF) modes carry most of the energy in the peak low-wavenumbers.
The PV (vortical) mode spectra also agree well in that they do not
contribute to the most energetic low wave numvers (corresponding to
the peak in the $k_h=0$ spectrum but they make the dominant
contribution to the low wavenumbers $k < 8$ but the energy in these
low modes is an order of magnitude less than the peak in $10< k <15$.
We also show in addition the wave modes which SW02 does not show. We
do not show the potential energy spectrum which SW02 does show.

\section{Bousinesq scalars we're interested in computing}

We'd like to compute the following (dimensional) quantities integrated
around in the volume:

\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Total energy and total energy dissipation

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \frac{1}{2} \int_V  
         \left[  (u^2 + v^2 + w^2) +   \theta^2\right]  
= \frac{1}{2}\int_V \left[  \nu \nabla^2 (u^2 + v^2 + w^2)  
                     + \kappa \nabla^2 \theta^2
                         \right] 
\end{equation}

\item[2.] Potential energy, $\frac{1}{2} \theta^2$ 

\item[3.] Kinetic energy, $\frac{1}{2} ( u^2 + v^2 + w^2 )$ 
  
\item[4.] Potential vorticity (q) and its production-dissipation which
  should globally integrate to zero I think.
  \begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_V   
           \left[ q \right]  
  = \int_V \left[ \nu (\nabla^2 \mathbf\omega) \cdot \mathbf{\nabla}
    (\bar{\theta})
                       + \kappa (\nabla^2 \mathbf{\nabla} \theta) \cdot  
                       (\mathbf\omega  
                       + \text{fcor} ~{\bf{\hat{z}}} ))  
                           \right]  
  \end{equation}
  
  Here $\mathbf = \mathbf\nabla \times \mathbf u$ is the vorticity and
  $\bar\theta = \theta_o -\text{bous}~ z + \theta(x,y,z)$. Also, $q =
  (\mathbf\omega + \text{fcor}~\mathbf{\hat{z}}) \cdot \mathbf\nabla
  \bar\theta.$

\item[5.] Potential enstrophy $Q = q^2/2$ and its
  production-dissipation. This is the important production-dissipation
  rate we need for our two-point correlation.

\item[6.] Potential vorticity production-dissipation

\item[7.] Potential enstrophy
  \begin{equation} 
    \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int_V   \left[ Q \right]   
    = \int_V \left[ \nu  ~q (~\nabla^2 ~\mathbf\omega) \cdot \mathbf{\nabla}
      (\bar{\theta})   
      + \kappa  ~q ~\nabla^2 (\mathbf{\nabla} \theta) \cdot  
      (\mathbf\omega   
      + \text{fcor} ~{\bf{\hat{z}}} ))   
    \right]   
  \end{equation} 

\item[8.] two-point correlation (coming)

\end{itemize}

\section{Comparing SW to KSW}
In the two-point correlation paper the equations we use are scaled
differently than than we use in Mark's code (which are the same
equations used in SW). To make comparisions with our results in the
two-point correlation paper we have to keep in mind the following
scalings. Note, these are relationships between {\sl{dimensional}}
quantities, not nondimensional quantities.
\begin{gather}
\tilde\rho = (\frac{b \rho_o}{g})^{1/2} ~\theta\\
(\frac{g}{\rho_o b})^{1/2}~\rho = (\frac{g \rho_o}{b}) - \text{bous}
~z + \theta = \bar\theta \\
N = \text{bous} = (\frac{g b}{\rho_o})^{1/2}\\
pe_{\text{ksw}} = \frac{1}{2} \theta^2 = \frac{g}{\rho_o b} \tilde\rho^2\\
q_{\text{ksw}} = (\frac{g}{b \rho_o})^{1/2} q_{\text{SW}}
\end{gather}
