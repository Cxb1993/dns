9/29/01  CFL and viscosity test

128x128 Kelvin Helmholz initial condition.
How much viscosity is needed to keep solution smooth?


mu=.00001   cfl=.25   noisy at t=1
mu=.00005   cfl=.25   ?
mu=.0001    cfl=1.70  smooth, round vortex with 2 filiments at t=1

mu=.00005   128x128 does not look like 256x256.   (cfl=1.0)
mu=.0002    128x128 does look like 2565x256       (cfl=1.0)

So, 128x128 can resolve a viscosity of .0002 out to t=1.0,
but it cannot resolve a viscosity of .00005

Now test CFL, using the "looks good norm, at t=1.0"

CFL rk4
3.0   vorticity looks bad
2.5   vorticity looks bad
2.2   vorticity looks bad
2.1   vorticity looks good
2.0   vorticity looks good - same as 256sx256 result
      running past t=1? 
CFL rk3  (1.5 rk3 = same cost as 2.0 rk4)
2.0   bad
1.5   bad
1.4   some bad oscillations
1.35  looks good
1.25  looks good
1.0   looks good

Result: rk4 is more efficient.

What about looking at energy spectrum, or structure funtions?

CFL:  128x128

dealiased, vis=0
cfl_adv
2.0   t=.5 bad - streaks of vorticity off of sheet
      but stable so far (1200 time steps, t=7)
1.90  t=.5 bad, not as bas as t=2.0
1.80  t=.5 ok
1.75  t=.5 ok
1.50  t=.5 ok
1.15  t=.5 ok
1.00  t=.5 ok


dealiased, vis=.0001
2.0:  t=.5 bad - smoother, but still has streaks of vorticity off of sheet
      t=1.0  oval vortex + two filiments - outer filiment has oscillations
    
1.70  t=.5  looks good - much smoother than vis=0
      t=1.0 looks good - round vortex + two filiments with no oscillations

1.00  t=1.0 looks good - round vortex + two filiments with no oscillations
