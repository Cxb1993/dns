8/9/01  KH 1024x1024 

mu = .0002/8 = 2.5e-5
CFL = 1.5
run to time=3.  Looks good.  







**********************************************************************************
8/7/01  More 128x128 runs.  

128x128 can handle mu=.0002 to t=1.  What happens if we run longer?

KH inintial condition:

4th order:

CFL=2.0   t=4 noisy, but just two large blobs
CFL=1.9   t=4 looks good, t=10 is noisy
CFL=1.8   t=10 ok, t=20 noisy
CFL=1.7   t=20 ok, t=30 noisy.
CFL=1.65  goes bad at t=47! 
CFL=1.6   t=4 ok, t=10 ok, t=30 ok, t=50 ok
CFL=1.5   t=4 ok, t=10 ok, t=30 ok, t=50 ok
CFL=1.0   t=4 looks good, t=10 looks good.  two large blobs


3rd order:

CFL=1.5   t=1 looks bad.
CFL=1.25  goes bad around t=22
CFL=1.20  t=50 looks good.  
CFL=1.125 t=50 looks good.n
CFL=1.0   t=50 looks good.

4th order cost: 4/1.6 = 2.5            
3rd order cost: 3/1.20 = 2.5

So for this problem, might as well use rk4.

9/29/01  CFL and viscosity test

128x128 Kelvin Helmholz initial condition.
How much viscosity is needed to keep solution smooth?


mu=.00001   cfl=.25   noisy at t=1
mu=.00005   cfl=.25   ?
mu=.0001    cfl=1.70  smooth, round vortex with 2 filiments at t=1

mu=.00005   128x128 does not look like 256x256.   (cfl=1.0)
mu=.0002    128x128 does look like 2565x256       (cfl=1.0)

So, 128x128 can resolve a viscosity of .0002 out to t=1.0,
but it cannot resolve a viscosity of .00005

Now test CFL, using the "looks good norm, at t=1.0"

CFL rk4
3.0   vorticity looks bad
2.5   vorticity looks bad
2.2   vorticity looks bad
2.1   vorticity looks good
2.0   vorticity looks good - same as 256x256 result
      running past t=1? 

CFL rk3  (1.5 rk3 = same cost as 2.0 rk4)
2.0   bad
1.5   bad
1.4   some bad oscillations
1.35  looks good
1.25  looks good
1.0   looks good

Result: rk4 is more efficient.

What about looking at energy spectrum, or structure funtions?
