This file describes some of the matlab analysis routines
included with the DNS project.


isoave.m:
   computes angle averages of structure function data.
   analysis_isoave.F90 will compute structures functions
   from a single snapshow at 47 different directions.

   We then used STRIPACK to construct the Voronoi diagram for
   all these directions (represented as points on the sphere)
   and then take the weight of each direction to be the
   spherical area of the voronoi cell containing the point on the 
   sphere associated with the direction
